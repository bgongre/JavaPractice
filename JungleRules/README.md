#JungleRules

This program creates 3 animal objects (snake, monkey, and tiger) that are given a starting energy level to do random activities, some of the activites give the animals energy back. If the animal does not have the energy to perform the random activity the animal will let you know. There is also a method that can be used have the animals "sound off" reporting both their respected sound and energy level.
